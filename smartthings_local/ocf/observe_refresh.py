"""Periodic OBSERVE re-subscribe.

CoAP OBSERVE (RFC 7641) has no built-in TTL, but real-world peers age
out observer state on their own schedule — Samsung's RT-OCF is known
to silently drop notify delivery during cloud auth blips even though
the DTLS session stays healthy. Without a re-subscribe, recovery from
such a blip requires a full session reconnect.

This task derregisters the current observer tokens and re-subscribes
every `interval_s`. Cheap (one register CON per path), idempotent
(Samsung silently no-ops a register on an already-active token), and
resilient — individual subscribe failures are logged but don't abort
the task.
