"""DTLS-layer liveness via CoAP empty-CON ping + poll-success watchdog.

Each interval_s the task:
  1. Sends a CoAP ping. This is fire-and-forget — Samsung's RT-OCF
     doesn't reliably reply with an RST, so the send itself is the
     keepalive (it tickles Samsung's observer state). The send only
     fails if the underlying socket is gone, in which case the failure
     counts toward fail_threshold.
  2. Calls liveness_fn() if provided. This is the real half-open
     detection: PollScheduler exposes last_success_ts, and the bridge
     wraps it as "did we get a 2.05 in the last 60s". If not, count
     the tick as a failure even though the ping send succeeded.

After fail_threshold consecutive failures, fires on_unreachable. First
success after a fail streak fires on_reachable. Bridge wires these to
MQTT availability.
