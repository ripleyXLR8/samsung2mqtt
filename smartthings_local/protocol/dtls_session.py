"""CoAP-over-DTLS client for Samsung RT-OCF appliances (RFC 7252 + 6347).

Replaces the TLS-over-TCP transport used in the original dryer bridge.
Both the oven (UDP/49154) and the dryer (UDP/49155) speak CoAP-over-DTLS
with the ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 cipher and a client cert.

Wire-level details that matter (from local-tools/oven-findings.md §17):
  * DTLS ciphertext MTU must be 1200; otherwise OpenSSL fragments the
    client cert across two datagrams and TizenRT drops the second.
  * Samsung's RT-OCF uses ACK+separate-CON for the larger responses.
    The reader MUST correlate by (token, mid) — not arrival order —
    or interleaved one-shot / OBSERVE traffic mis-attributes.
  * Multi-block GET requires the SAME CoAP token across every block
    of the response ("token-stable Block2"). Fresh-token-per-block
    is silently dropped by the server, and a transfer that opens at
    NUM>0 under a token the server has not seen gets no reply at all.

Reader thread owns the UDP socket. Callers issue get()/post() and block
on a per-token Event the reader signals. OBSERVE notifications are
delivered via the on_notification callback.

A notification carries only the first block of a large representation
(RFC 7959 §2.6). Because a continuation cannot borrow the observation's
token (§3.4) and this server will not continue a transfer it did not
start, such a notification is withheld and the resource is re-read from
block 0 on a fresh one-shot token by a worker thread. See #39.
