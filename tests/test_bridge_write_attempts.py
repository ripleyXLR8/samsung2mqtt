"""WRITE_MAX_ATTEMPTS plumbing: env var -> SharedConfig -> the session.

The library flag exists so a lost write can be measured on real hardware
before retransmission is turned on anywhere. That measurement happens on
the bridge, so the bridge has to be able to set it -- and, far more
importantly, has to keep defaulting to one send until someone chooses
otherwise.
