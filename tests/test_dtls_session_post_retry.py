"""Write-path retransmission and liveness (LocalThings#384, #396).

`post()` sent its datagram exactly once and then waited on a bare
`ev.wait(timeout)`, while `get()` retransmitted every block through
`_exchange_block`. One lost datagram was therefore an unrecoverable write
and a silent no-op for a read — three unrelated resources on one AC all
failing with `SessionTimeoutError` is what surfaced it.

Retransmission ships off by default (`write_max_attempts=1`): a device
already dropping under load turns one lost write into several, and MID
dedupe is unverified on RT-OCF. These tests pin both the default's
unchanged single send and the behaviour the flag buys when it is on.

The MID registry these lean on is #57's, shared with the read path; #58
gave `_exchange_block` the same one-datagram-per-exchange shape. What is
specific to writes is the attempt loop: its backoff, its pacing, and the
frames that must stop it.
